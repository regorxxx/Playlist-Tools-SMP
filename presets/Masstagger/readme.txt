These are scripts for Masstagger component (foo_masstag) which can be imported at their 'Manage Scripts' panel.

The names are self explanatory and may come handy to other people too. Some of them are meant to be used by
custom buttons at any bar to apply the script directly to the selected items for easy tagging during playback.
That applies for example to moods, instrumental tracks, etc. Others are meant to be applied to the entire library.

Loading them into Masstagger allows to see their actions anyway, so that should tell you what they do too, along
a preview of the changes.
