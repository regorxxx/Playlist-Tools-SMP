TF scripts for foobar2000's UI, both CUI and DUI versions.

Some of these scripts are meant to be used along the SMP scripts or tags usually used by them. For ex. the Camelot Keys script, 
which allows to translate standard keys to Camelot notation and display their position in the scale for easy manual mixing.
