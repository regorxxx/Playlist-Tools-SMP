An utility to easily set main Spider Monkey Panel menu entries found at 'File\Spider Monkey Panel\...' which are numbered from 1 to 9.

Since one of the main limitations of those entries is they are named with numbers without any indication of what they do at all, to
which script they are associated or an easy way to configure it without editing code, the utility tries to solve all that by giving 
a simple menu which lists all menus set (along their number). The menus can be easily set at any time without coding at all to 
arbitrary functions (associated to an script which is 'included' automatically), menu entries or predefined examples.
They can also be removed or restored to defaults values at any time.

Note that if you don't want to use this tool and use your own panel with an script to set the menus, you can simply disable the associated
menu (like any other tool) to skip loading it.

This utility is not only intended as a workaround to one of the main limitations of SMP, but as a way to integrate Playlist Tools
with online controllers. Since online controllers like foo_httpcontrol (https://bitbucket.org/oblikoamorale/foo_httpcontrol/wiki/Home)
can not interact in any way with custom buttons, UI elements or SMP scripts, the only way to 'use' some of these scripts is associating
a tool to a main menu entry. SMP offers 9 customizable entries for that. Usually, one would create their own script to configure those menus,
but that clearly limits its use to simple scripts or utilities... having this functionality built-in within Playlist Tools allows not only
setting your own customized scripts but also using all the tools found within this utility! In other words, it allows to also use any of the
tools included via remote commands. Some examples (*) (**):
	
	- Wanna create automatic playlists via pools using your phone or an internet browser? Set menu 1 to 'Pools\Top tracks mix'.
	Then call it via http control server (any of the two):
	http://localhost:8888/default?cmd=CmdLine&param1=/command:%221%22
	http://localhost:8888/default?cmd=CmdLine&param1=/command:"1"
	
	Playlist will be created and set as active playlist. A refresh may be needed in the online controller to change focus to the currently active
	playlist (otherwise switch to it manually).
	
	- What about removing duplicates from current playlist? Set menu 2 to 'Duplicates and tag filtering\Remove duplicates by title, artist, date'.
	Fill any playlist in your online controller and then call it via http control server (any of the two):
	http://localhost:8888/default?cmd=CmdLine&param1=/command:%222%22
	http://localhost:8888/default?cmd=CmdLine&param1=/command:"2"
	
	And it will be applied to current playlist. Same comment apply about refreshing.
	
	- What about searching similar tracks to current one? Set menu 3 to 'Search same by tags...\By Styles (=2) and Moods (=6)'.
	Select any song (or focus on it, or put it alone in a playlist) in your online controller and then call it via http control server (any of the two):
	http://localhost:8888/default?cmd=CmdLine&param1=/command:%222%22
	http://localhost:8888/default?cmd=CmdLine&param1=/command:"2"
	
	And it will use that track as input for the playlist creation. Same comment apply about refreshing.

As can be seen, any Playlist Tool menu entry (or even custom scripts) can be set, therefore the sky is the limit... remember you can also set macros 
to be used here, so anything can be automatized without limits.

foo_httpcontrol even allows to create your own templates (for the web UI), so instead of using an http url, you can easily create your own buttons associated to
the 9 SMP entries for direct access. Since SMP even allows to set output devices with scripts, this piece finally allows to treat foobar as a complete music server 
capable of replacing online servers like Spotify with intelligent playlist creation, auto-dj, etc. You can control anything via foo_httpcontrol+SMP+Playlist Tools.
Such template already exists and it's named ajquery-SMP (ajquery-xxx).

A phone App like 'HTTP Request Shortcuts' can also automatize all this process if using an App, which obviously can not be user-set to add custom buttons. Otherwise,
http urls must be sent via browser (*).

(*) Another approach would be sending commands creating playlists with specific command names. Specially useful for phone Apps. See Playlist Names Commands readme.
(**) Menu names may be easily retrieved by simulating menu execution with Ctrl + L. Click, which copies entry names to clipboard.
