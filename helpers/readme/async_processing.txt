Asynchronous execution refers to the execution of some code done on the background (usually
on iterative steps) For ex. external playlist files loading on native Foobar2000.

Enabling asynchronous processing for specific tools will not block the UI while executing them, 
allowing to continue using Foobar2000 without interruptions, but as a side-effect they will
also take more time to finish.

Feature is only noticeable when processing a high number of tracks or computationally heavy tasks.
