Presets are menu entries which can be imported or exported on demand.
All added menu entries by the user are also considered 'presets', i.e.
they can be managed the same than external presets.

When importing a presets file, the menu entries will be added to any other
already present. They will not be replaced.

When exporting, all user set entries (that includes any presets imported
before) are saved as a json file. Therefore, to only export a few menu 
entries, export all and then selectively delete those desired on the json
file with any text editor. In other words, selective exporting is not
supported.

Menu entries can be deleted or reset at any time by using the appropriate
option on each tool sub-menu or resetting all on configuration. Therefore
menu deletion can be done in three ways, individually (per entry), locally
(per tool) or globally (all tools).
