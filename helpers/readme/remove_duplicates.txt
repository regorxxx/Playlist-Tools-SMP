Removes tracks with same tags (also real duplicated files) from playlists.
It's superior to foobar2000 functionality since it checks more things than
just having the same exact file multiple times...

Note you can use these functions to filter lists! i.e. if you only check 
by artist/date, then any track with same artist/date is considered
duplicated.

That means this could be used both to find duplicates or for custom 
post-playlist creation filtering (1 track per artist, 1 track per date,
etc.)

Usage on playlist tools:
	- Tags and n+1 var may be set via menus.
	- See comments below (buttons) for usage. It applies the same.

Usage on buttons:
	- Tags or TF expressions may be set via menus. There
	are	3 possible fields, but multiple tags may also be set in the 
	same field. ('%ARTIST% - %TITLE% - %DATE%' is equivalent to setting
	them separately on the 3 properties)
	- When adding a tag on a field, '%' may be omitted. When adding
	multiple tags or TF expressions, you must add all TF symbols 
	(% and $).
	- Setting the n+1 duplicates allowed variable is used for the
	filtering button. A value of 0 makes it work as the remove 
	duplicates button (no duplicates allowed). A value of 1, would 
	allow 2 (1+1) tracks with the same set tags...
	- Since the tags are configurable, the concept of 'duplicate' is
	related to those tags... that's why this tool may also be used to
	filter playlists instead of removing real duplicates too.
