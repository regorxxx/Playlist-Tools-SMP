A utility to run multiple main menus with one single click. For ex.
to completely switch playback statistics/scrobbling at once (which
may involve up to 3 menu entries with some plugins).

Also allows to call such menus before closing foobar, according 
to button state (enabled/disabled). Button state may be saved 
between sessions and will change when clicking on the button.

Entries are added with a name (just cosmetic), and a command
which should point to the full menu path: "Playback/Play".
There are some built-in presets which may be used as examples.

Some specific menus (like those related to playback) only work
if the playback follows the cursor or the focus is set to an specific
track. Such advanced options may be set with the following modifiers:
	- PlaybackFollowCursor: true|false
	- CursorFollowPlayback: true|false
	- idx: 0 (first) to X (last)
	- timeout: >= 0 (ms)

For ex. to play the first track, the JSON entry would be:
	{"name":"Play current pls","command":"Playback/Play",
	"idx":0,"PlaybackFollowCursor":true}
	
For ex. to undo 5 secs after last action:
	{"name":"Undo (async),"command":"Edit/Undo",
	"timeout":5000}
	
Entry name, command and timeout are set popups when adding new
entries. Other modifiers require editing the entry (as JSON).
