All tools use a default set of tags, pretty standard, remapped like:
	- Date -> $year(%DATE%)			- Artist -> ARTIST
	- Genre: -> GENRE			- Style: -> STYLE
	- Mood: -> MOOD				- Bpm -> BPM
	- Key -> KEY				- Rating -> %RATING%

There are many more! For a comprehensive list check:
[FOOBAR_PROFILE]\js_data\presets\global\globTags.json

By default all tools will tend to use such associations whenever they are
not configured to use other tags or remapping. Many tools have specific
customizable remapping options (for ex. 'Music Map' tools), while
others -which use queries- are simply easily editable manually.

In case you want to globally remap a tag, without having to manually edit
the configuration of every tool... the files found at the folder at top
can be edited. In such case every new script installed will automatically
load those values, and existing tools will require a 'Restore defaults',
'Reset configuration' or similar action to reload them.

Note your personalized settings may be lost on the process, so it should
be done as soon as possible when installing scripts for the first time.

This may come handy for tools which involve queries, since those are
usually set on the scripts their-selves and can not be set in a way
compatible with every user's tag patterns. This patches that hole.

Example:
	Let's say in our library the date of a track is associated to
	'ORIGINAL RELEASE DATE' instead of 'DATE' tag (not recommended,
	such tagging pattern will break compatibility with most software).

	If we want to remap all date usage to our custom tag, just edit
	'globTags.json' and change:
		[...]
		"date": "$year(%DATE%)",
		[...]
	To:
		[...]
		"date": "$year(%ORIGINAL RELEASE DATE%)",
		[...]
