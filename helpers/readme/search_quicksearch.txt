Tool similar to foo_quicksearch, which allows searching for tracks with
same tag values, beginning with them or by partial matching. Results may
be sent to a playlist, Autoplaylist or search window using keyboard
modifiers (shown on the tool).

Buttons usage:
	- Entries are hardcoded.
	- By default sends results to a [configurable] playlist.
	- Shift sends results to search window.
	- Ctrl creates an Autoplaylist with the result.
	- To add customized entries, use Playlist Tools\Dynamic queries.

Original foo_quicksearch only allowed exact matches by queries, but
this tool allows two additional modes:
	- Begins with...: 
		Will match any track starting with the original value. 
		For ex. 'Begins with Genre' would allow 'Jazz' and 'Jazz Vocal' 
		in results, when selecting a jazz track since all start with 
		'Jazz' string on the genre tag. This method is pretty situational
		and probably most used for Title tags.
	
	- Partial match...: 
		Expands the previous method, allowing any result which matches
		any portion of the string. For ex. 'Begins with Title', for a 
		track named 'Yesterday' would output tracks named 'Yes', 'Y',
		'Yesterday', 'Yesterdays', ...

This tool uses Dynamic Queries under the hood. Readme may be found
at 'Others\Dynamic queries' or at Playlist Tools button.
