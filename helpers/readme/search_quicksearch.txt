Tool similar to foo_quicksearch, which allows searching for tracks with
same tag values, beginning with them or by partial matching. Results may
be sent to a playlist, AutoPlaylist or search window using keyboard
modifiers (shown on the tool).

Original foo_quicksearch:
https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_quicksearch

Buttons usage:
	- By default sends results to a [configurable] playlist.
	- Shift sends results to search window.
	- Ctrl creates an AutoPlaylist with the result.
	- Shit + Ctrl uses the current playlist as source for the lookup.
	- To add customized entries, use Playlist Tools\Dynamic queries
		or configure the button pressing shift.
	- Advanced entries (see below) are automatically created if
		they would produce valid queries/searches.

Original foo_quicksearch only allowed exact matches by queries, but
this tool allows three additional modes:
	- Begins with...:
		Will match any track starting with the original value.
		For ex. 'Begins with Genre' would allow 'Jazz' and 'Jazz
		Vocal' in results, when selecting a jazz track since all
		start with 'Jazz' string on the genre tag. This method is
		pretty situational and probably most used for Title tags.

	- Partially includes...:
		Will match any track containing the original value.
		For ex. 'Partially includes same Genre' would allow 'Jazz',
		'Vocal Jazz Contemporary' and 'Jazz-Rock' in results,
		when selecting a jazz track since all contain the 'Jazz'
		string on the genre tag.

	- Partial match...:
		Expands the previous method, allowing any result which
		matches any portion of the string. For ex. 'Begins with
		Title', for a track named 'Yesterday' would output tracks
		named 'Yes', 'Y', 'Yesterday', 'Yesterdays', ...

This tool uses Dynamic Queries under the hood. Readme may be found
at 'Others\Dynamic queries' or at Playlist Tools button.
