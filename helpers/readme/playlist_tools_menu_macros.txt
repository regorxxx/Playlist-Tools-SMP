Macros are pre-recorded multiple calls to different menu entries.
It works in conjunction with the menu framework (Menu-Framework-SMP),
and used in Playlist Tools for saving sets of tools.

Usage:
	- Start recording a macro (and give it a name).
	- (Playlist Tools tip: Using sep as name, will add a separator on
	the list)
	- Use any menu entry as desired.
	- ...
	- Stop recording and save.

Limitations:
	- Saves clicked entries by name. i.e. They must be unique.
	- Entries which use invisible IDs to not duplicate submenus can not
	be used. Currently:
		- Selection \ Find now playing track in... (only when
		sub-lists are created)
		- Selection \ Find track(s) in... (only when sub-lists
		are created)
		- Selection \ Remove track(s) from... (only when sub-lists
		are	created)
		- (ALL) \ Remove entry from list... (no need to delete menu
		entries with macros anyway!)
		- Configuration \ ... (no need to set those with macros
		anyway!)
	- Can not save user input on popups. Using entries which make use
	of those on macros will require user input every time they are
	called later.
