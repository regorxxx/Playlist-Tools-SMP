Reads a txt file containing a track list and find matches, if possible,
on library. The results are output to a new playlist ('Import').
The input path may be a file path or an url pointing to a txt file.

Specially useful to easily create playlists (with matches from your
library) from online playlists, charts, etc. (like '100 greatest rock
songs', ...). Skipping the need to manually add one by one the tracks
to your own version of the playlist. Not found tracks are reported 
with a popup.

A txt file example can be found at: '.\examples\track_list_to_import.txt'
Patterns may be arbitrary, and can be set at the input box. For ex:
	1. Respect - Aretha Franklin
	2. Louie Louie - Kingsmen
	...
Would require a pattern like this:
	[". ","%title%"," - ","%artist%"]

Strings with '%' are considered tags, the rest are breakpoints or 
parts of the text which will be omitted (before ". " all is omitted).

For key matching, both the original key and prefix-stripped are used
at the query (%artist% or %album artist%). For ex:
	1. Shapes of things - Yardbirds
	2. Route 66 - The Rolling Stones
	...
Query matching becomes (note the artist name is prefix-stripped at 2):
	1: '(title IS shapes of things) AND (artist IS yardbirds OR 
	$stripprefix(artist,a,the,la,los,las,el) IS yardbirds) 
	AND (NOT genre IS live AND NOT style IS live)'
	2: '(title IS route 66) AND (artist IS the rolling stones OR
	$stripprefix(artist,a,the,la,los,las,el) IS rolling stones) 
	AND (NOT genre IS live AND NOT style IS live)'

By default duplicates are removed, 1 track per (%artist%, %title%). (*)
Live tracks are skipped, matching only studio tracks if possible ('genre' 
or 'style' tags must be present on files, with a value 'Live').

(*) Note in rare cases multiple matches could pass through the filter:
Track A by Artist A -> (importTextPlaylist) -> output:
		01 - Track A -> Artist: Artist A//Artist B
		01 - Track A -> Artist: Artist A
Since the default filter compares title and artist, both tracks are 
"different" because only one artist is matched. Thus both tracks would
be sent to the playlist. This behavior is preferred to only use title on
the filter by default, since there could be cases where a list has same
titles names by different artists:
Track A by Artist A
...
Track A by Artist B
