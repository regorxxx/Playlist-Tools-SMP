Search n most played tracks on library. Sorting is done by play
count by default (requires foo_playcount plugin).

To be able to filter played tracks by specific time periods, like
most played tracks during 2019, foo_enhanced_playcount plugin is 
needed. When such plugin is installed, such tool will be available
to use. See 'Most played tracks from...' readme.

Duplicates by title - artist - date are removed, so it doesn't
output the same tracks multiple times like an auto-playlist does
(if you have multiple versions of the same track).
