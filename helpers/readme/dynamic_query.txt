Filters the library by query and sends results to a new playlist.
Similar to what foobar search or some search/filter plugins do.
Dynamic queries are also allowed in Query filtering and Pools.

For filtering purposes:
- Empty query will try to apply global forced query if enabled, 
otherwise gets replaced with 'ALL'.
- 'ALL' will never apply forced query, even if enabled.

Rules:
- Dynamic variables are allowed too, enclosed on '#': #ARTIST#, 
#$year(%date%)#, ...
- These placeholders will be replaced with focused item\'s TF result on 
execution.
- Using tags alone, translates into multivalue tags/queries by default.
- When using TF expressions ($...), tags are not converted and the 
expression is executed 'as is'.
- Standard queries may be added -only- to the end of a dynamic query 
expression.
- Multiple dynamic multivalued variables are allowed, but they must be 
enclosed on parenthesis to work.
- In any case queries are tested before using it, so errors will be 
shown as a popup.

Some examples: 
For a rock track, 'GENRE IS #GENRE#' would translate into 'GENRE IS Rock'.
The entire library would be filtered with tracks from that genre.

For a rock and electronic track, 'GENRE IS #GENRE#' would translate into 
'(GENRE IS Rock) AND (GENRE IS Electronic) '. Note multi-value tags are
splitted and produce multiple query entries by default. (*)

For a Dylan's track, 'COMPOSER IS #ARTIST#' would translate into 
'COMPOSER IS Bob Dylan'. And the entire library would be filtered with 
any track written by him.

Merging standard and dynamic variables like 'GENRE IS #GENRE# AND NOT
(%rating% EQUAL 2 OR %rating% EQUAL 1)' would translate into
'(GENRE IS Psychedelic Rock) AND (GENRE IS Hard Rock) AND NOT (%rating%
EQUAL 2 OR %rating% EQUAL 1)'. Note the standard query expression is
added at the end.

Multiple dynamic queries like '((GENRE IS #GENRE#) OR (STYLE IS 
#STYLE#))' translates into '(((GENRE IS Psychedelic Rock) AND (GENRE IS
 Hard Rock)) OR ((STYLE IS Acid Rock) AND (STYLE IS Live)))'.
Note how the parenthesis are used to limit dynamic expansion.

Multiple dynamic queries like '((DATE IS #DATE#) OR (DATE IS 
#$add(%DATE%,1)#))' translates into '((DATE IS 1969) OR (DATE IS
 1970))'. So in fact the parenthesis are redundant.
 
Therefore '(DATE IS #DATE# OR DATE IS #$add(%DATE%,1)#) would translate 
into '(DATE IS 1969 OR DATE IS 1970)' without problems. Note how single
valued tags don't need extra parenthesis since dynamic 
expansion does not apply.

(*) Since '#TAG# IS VALUE' forces tag to be equal to value, muti-value 
tags follow the same rationale. If you want to use another logic (OR,
combinations, etc.) between different values of the same tag
then the tool to use would be 'Search Same By'.
