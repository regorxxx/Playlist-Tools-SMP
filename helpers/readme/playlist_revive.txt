Alternative to foo_playlist_revive.
Playlist Revive makes dead items in a playlist alive again by replacing them with the matching ones in media library.
A handy utility for those who often move or rename their media files/folders.

Querying:
	- TITLE
	- AUDIOMD5 (tag from foo_md5 if found) (*)
	- MD5 (tag from foo_md5 if found) (*)

Matching (rules by order):
	- Audio MD5 (file info) (Exact Match) (*)
	- AUDIOMD5 (tag from foo_md5 if found) (Exact Match) (*)
	- MD5 (tag from foo_md5 if found) (Exact Match) (*) (**)
	- TITLE + Length + Size (Exact Match)
	- Tags (Similarity)

Usage:
	- Select the tracks in the relevant playlist.
	- Apply script (using a button, menu entry, main menu SMP, etc. associated to it).
	- The tools allow to only replace with exact matches or by some similarity threshold. 
	- 'Simulate' options just simulates the processing, does nothing but reporting you -planned- changes.
	- The console always reports the tracks changed and info, contrary to what foo_playlist_revive plugin did.

(*) Audio MD5 is a feature of some formats which store audio checksums as part of their file info. 
That's different, although similar, to a tag named AUDIOMD5 (or MD5) by foo_md5 plugin.
On the first step -querying-, the tag is used if available (it's not a requisite).
On the second step -matching-, the file info is used if available (for some formats), if it's not found
then it tries the tag counterpart. If it's not found it tries the next rule, ...
(**) foo_md5 plugin lets you configure the tag name. I use those 2 as possible names to look for.
Plugin can be found here: https://foobar.hyv.fi/?view=foo_audiomd5
Note that for formats having CRC checks (like flac), you can also get an md5 tag with mass tagger scripts:
$info(md5) -> copy -> AUDIOMD5
You can find such preset at '.\presets\Masstagger'
