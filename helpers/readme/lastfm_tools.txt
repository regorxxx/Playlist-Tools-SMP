Allows to create a playlist from Last.fm urls. Either supplied by the user
or generated automatically by Artist (top tracks), Title (similar tracks), 
Genre or other Folksonomy tags (top tracks), etc.

It tries to match results with tracks on library, otherwise YouTube links
will be used if foo_youtube component is installed.

Used along WilB's Biography Script, if selection mode on bio panel is set 
to 'Follow selected track', additional tags are shown on the submenus
directly provided by the Bio script (like the 'locale' tag). Using 
'Prefer now playing' mode will disable this feature unless the selected 
track is also the now playing track when using the button.
