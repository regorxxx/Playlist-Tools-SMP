Allows to create a playlist from Last.fm urls. Either supplied by the user
or generated automatically by Artist (top tracks), Title (similar tracks), 
Genre or other Folksonomy tags (top tracks), etc.

It tries to match results with tracks on library, otherwise YouTube links
will be used if foo_youtube component is installed.
