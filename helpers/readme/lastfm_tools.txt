Allows to create a playlist from Last.fm urls. Either supplied by the user
or generated automatically by Artist (top tracks), Title (similar tracks), 
Genre or other Folksonomy tags (top tracks), etc.

It tries to match results with tracks on library, otherwise YouTube links
will be used if foo_youtube component is installed.

Used along WilB's Biography Script, if selection mode on bio panel is set 
to 'Follow selected track', additional tags are shown on the submenus
directly provided by the Bio script (like the 'locale' tag). Using 
'Prefer now playing' mode will disable this feature unless the selected 
track is also the now playing track when using the button. 

In any case, Bio panel must be set to notify tags to other panels to make
it work (this setting is disabled by default). It may be found on the HTML
options panel or the 'biography.cfg' configuration file. Ask to its author
for further support.

Used along World-Map-SMP, no matter the selection mode, 'locale' tags
will be retrieved from database whenever it's possible, even for 
multi-value artist tags. They will also work even if no Bio panel
is present (or the track is not found by Bio panel), as long as
the artist is on the database (for ex. for manually tagged artists).
