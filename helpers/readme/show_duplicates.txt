Show tracks with same tags (also real duplicated files) from playlists.
It can be considered the inverse function to remove duplicates tool

Can be used to show tracks with same MD5, fingerprint, etc. For ex:

Usage on playlist tools:
	- Tags may be set via menus.
	- See comments below (buttons) for usage. It applies the same.

Usage on buttons:
	- Tags or TF expressions may be set via menus. There are
	3 possible fields, but multiple tags may also be set in the same field.
	('%ARTIST% - %TITLE% - %DATE%' is equivalent to setting them separately
	on the 3 properties)
	- When adding a tag on a field, '%' may be omitted. When adding multiple 
	tags or TF expressions, you must add all TF symbols (% and $).
	- Since the tags are configurable, the concept of 'duplicate' is
	related to those tags... that's why this tool may also be used to
	filter playlists instead of showing real duplicates too.

Note on 'Advanced RegExp title matching':
	Matching duplicates by %TITLE% may be somewhat tricky as soon as
	a library contains multiple versions of the same track. For ex:
	live, acoustic, remix versions, etc. To account for these, RegExp
	may be used, to allow partial matching to tracks with things like
	'(acoustic)' or '(2022 remix)' on the title.
	
	Obviously these are no real 'duplicates', but the philosophy behind
	the 'remove duplicates' concept is not having 2 times the same song
	on a playlist, so having multiple versions of the same track is
	undesirable in many cases. This feature can be selectively enabled
	or disabled.
