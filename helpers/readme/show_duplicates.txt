Show tracks with same tags (also real duplicated files) from playlists.
It can be considered the inverse function to remove duplicates tool

Can be used to show tracks with same MD5, fingerprint, etc. For ex:

Usage on playlist tools:
	- Tags may be set via menus.
	- See comments below (buttons) for usage. It applies the same.

Usage on buttons:
	- Tags or TF expressions may be set at the properties panel. There are
	3 possible fields, but multiple tags may also be set in the same field.
	('%ARTIST% - %TITLE% - %DATE%' is equivalent to setting them separately
	on the 3 properties)
	- When adding a tag on a field, '%' may be omitted. When adding multiple 
	tags or TF expressions, you must add all TF symbols (% and $).
	- Since the tags are configurable, the concept of 'duplicate' is
	related to those tags... that's why this tool may also be used to
	filter playlists instead of showing real duplicates too.
