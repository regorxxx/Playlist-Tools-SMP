Search n most rated tracks on library. Sorting is done by play
count by default (requires foo_playcount plugin).

In other words, 'Top rated from 2022' will display the tracks with
highest rating with %DATE% equal to 2022 (not rated during 2022,
since there is no way to know when the user added a rating!).

Duplicates by title - artist - date are removed, so it doesn't
output the same tracks multiple times like an auto-playlist does
(if you have multiple versions of the same track).
