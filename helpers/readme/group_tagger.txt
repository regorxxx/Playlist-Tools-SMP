Tool to calculate averages, sum or counts of tag values for tracks and
-optionally- save the result to another tag. A report is displayed showing
the results in any case.

It may be used to calculate album ratings, weights by duration, etc.

Modes:
------
There are multiple modes to aggregate tag values, with only one of them
also working with strings (like genres):
	- Average: average value per tag and TF expression (number).
	- Count: count every tag per TF expression (number).
	- Sum: total per tag and TF expression (number).
	- Mode: most frequent tag value (not limited to numbers).

Source tag:
-----------
The tag used for calculation, usually a single tag but a TF expression
may also be used. In any case it must output a number (or empty):
	- Rating: %RATING%
	- Rating/duration: $if(%RATING%,$mul(%LENGTH_SECONDS%, %RATING%),)
	- Number of artists: $meta_num(ARTIST)
	- Genres ('mode' only): GENRE|STYLE

Destination tag:
----------------
The tag used to write the output. Not providing one or canceling the popup
which asks for tagging will simply show the report without touching your
files. For ex:
	- Album Rating: %ALBUMRATING%
	- Number of artists: %ARTISTCOUNT%
	- Artist genre ('mode' only): %ARTISTGENRE%

Groups:
-------
Controls how tracks are considered part of the same set, like albums, etc.
Some common TF expressions you may want to use:
	- By album: %ALBUM%|%DATE%|%COMMENT%
	- By artist: %ARTIST%
	- By album artist: %ALBUM ARTIST%
	- By 1st artist: $if2($meta(ALBUM ARTIST,0),$meta(ARTIST,0))

Count:
------
TF expression for track count. This value is then used when calculating
averages to divide the sum of all values (from source tag) by the sum of
all count values. In most cases it should be 1 (i.e. every track counts a
s one), unless you want to weight averages by duration, etc. For ex:
	- By track: 1
	- By duration: %LENGTH_SECONDS%

Default value:
--------------
In cases where source tag TF expression or tag outputs no value, this
default value is used instead. You can set it to a number or cancel it
to skip counting tracks with missing values. For ex:
	- Add zero to count non-rated tracks as zero rating.
	- Cancel to ommit non-rated tracks on album rating calculation.
