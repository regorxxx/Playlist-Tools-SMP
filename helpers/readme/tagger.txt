Automatic tagging for selected tracks using multiple plugins:
	- foo_biometric (FooID Fingerprinting).
	- Chromaprint (ChromaPrint Fingerprinting).
	- foo_masstag (copy native MD5 to tag).
	- foo_audiomd5 (calculate audio MD5 from file).
	- foo_bpm (BPM).
	- foo_truepeak (Replay Gain, EBUR 128, DR, etc.).
	- foo_rgscan (Replay Gain).
	- foo_dynamic_range (DR).
	- foo_dr_meter (DR).
	- ffmpeg (EBUR 128).
	- Essentia (EBUR 128, Key, BPM & Danceness tags).

Dependencies:
	- Fooid plugin and binary file can be found at  '.\_resources'
	folder.

	- Chromaprint dependencies should be already included within
	this download.

	- ffmpeg requires to download 'ffmpeg.exe' from the web and
	place it into '.\helpers-external\ffmpeg\ffmpeg.exe'.

	- Essentia requires to download 'streaming_extractor_music.exe'
	and 'essentia_streaming_key.exe' from the web and
	place them into '.\helpers-external\essentia\...'.

	- For any other component related feature (foo_***), the plugin
	needs to be installed first by the user. Some may be available
	by default.

	- After (un)installing a dependency, a panel reload will be
	required.

Setting notes:
	- The settings submenu includes several settings which are
	guaranteed to work with all tools by default. If you changed
	anything at other component settings, you must ensure those
	changes	are reflected here too (tags, menu names or quiet mode).

	- Changing a setting at the menu only notifies the script about
	the setting but WILL NOT apply such setting to the external
	component. It must be changed at both places. i.e. setting a tool
	in quiet mode only ensures it will work within the script, but will
	not change the quiet mode setting at the components preferences
	window. You must do it by yourself.

	- The tags must be properly set at settings to ensure they are
	checked for deletion and verified after writing them. Not properly
	setting them will make the script to fail.

	- Every tool used must write different tags. This is somewhat
	ensured by the script when trying to enable multiple tools which
	write the same tag (for ex. DR meters), but it's the user
	responsibility to ensure it doesn't happen on purpose by changing
	the tools' tag settings.

Processing order:
	Remove ReplayGain -> FooId -> Masstager MD5 -> DR -> ChromaPrint
	-> ffmpeg LRA -> Folksonomy -> Essentia (fast) -> Essentia (rest)
	-> AudioMD5 -> ReplayGain - True Peak Scanner -> BPM
