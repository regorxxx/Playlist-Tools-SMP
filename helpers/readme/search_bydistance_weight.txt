Creates intelligent "spotify-like" playlists using high-level data from tracks similar
to the currently selected one according to genre, style, key, etc.
When their score is over 'scoreFilter', then they are included in the final pool.

WEIGHT presets work by matching genre\style tags (Rock != Hard Rock), without using complex logics.
Therefore they work with arbitrary tag values.
