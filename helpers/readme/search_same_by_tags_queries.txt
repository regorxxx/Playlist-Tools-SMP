Search n tracks (randomly) on library matching the tags given
according to the current selected track. This is a simplification
of Search Same by Tags Combinations, where all tag values must be
matched for every tag given using queries.

Playlist Tools Usage:
	- The number of output tracks may be set at global config.
	- Forced query to pre-filter tracks may be set at global config.
	- Tags may be set at the appropriate submenu.
	- Duplicates are filtered by title, artist & date.

Buttons usage:
	- The number of output tracks may be set at properties panel.
	- Forced query to pre-filter tracks may be set at properties panel.
	- Tags may be set at properties panel.
	- Duplicates may also be filtered using the appropriate setting at
	properties panel.

Note this ONLY USES already existing tags and queries, it will not
calculate similarity or anything else (like Music Map).
