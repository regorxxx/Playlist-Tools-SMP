Themes are 'tag containers' which emulate track's tags, to be used with
'search_bydistance' buttons and tools instead of evaluating with the selected track.

Recipes are 'variables containers' which emulate the args of 'search_bydistance'
buttons snd tools instead of using hardcoded variables or properties.
Note recipes may also contain a forced theme, either the entire object or a
link to a theme file (using its path or filename).

Both may be used in buttons, tools or with Playlist Tools:
	- Pools presets may link to these files in their arguments.
	- Search by GRAPH\WEIGHT\DYNGENRE menu presets may link to these files in
	their arguments to have menus which use the variables set on those files
	instead of harcoded in the menu (working similar to custom buttons).
	- Custom buttons may use recipes and themes to tweak their behavior (see tooltip).

Theme files may be created using the examples files.
When using Playlist Tools there is a menu entry (see Configuration\Search by Distance)
to use the selected track's tags as reference and save them to a json file directly.
In that case, the tags names put at the properties panel will be used.
i.e. you can remap genre to use 'genre' and 'All Music Genre', etc.
