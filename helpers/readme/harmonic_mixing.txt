DJ-like playlist creation with key changes following harmonic mixing rules... contiguous tracks in the mix are most often either in the same key, or their keys are relative or in a subdominant or dominant relationship with one another. The primary goal is to create a smooth transition between songs, creating an harmonious and consonant mashup with any music genre. 

Uses 9 movements described at 'camelotWheel' on camelot_wheel_xxx.js
The movements creates a 'path' along the track keys, so even changing or skipping one movement changes drastically the path;
Therefore, the track selection may change on every execution. Specially if there are not tracks on the pool to match all required movements. 
Those unmatched movements will get skipped (lowering the playlist length per step), but next movements are relative to the currently selected track... 
so successive calls on a 'small' pool, will give totally different playlist lengths. We are not matching only keys, but a 'key path', which is stricter.
