Button for all Fingerprint Tools, fingerprint search and tagging. The
different options are explained below:

	-Compare: Compares the fingerprint of the currently selected tracks
	and reports the similarity between them (in pairs).

	-Search: Searches the entire Foobar2000 library for tracks with
	similar fingerprint to the currently selected tracks.

	-Tag: Tags the currently selected tracks with fingerprints. There
	are 2 different algorithms:

		+ Chromaprint: the raw fingerprint is saved, not the
		encoded version provided by default by fpcalc.exe or other
		software like MusicBrainz Picard. Also the entire file is
		fingerprinted, not just the first 120 secs. This should be
		the preferred method (if you only want one).

		+FooID: legacy algorithm which requires an external
		component installed (see below), not compatible with
		x64 foobar2000. Requires 'foo_biometric' to be installed
		on Foobar2000, 	along its 'Fooid.dll'. All required files
		can be found at '_resources', along installation notes.

	-ChromaPrint database: Creates a reverse indexed database for
	faster lookups. Specially useful for large libraries. Requires
	to be recreated on library changes (automatically checked). In
	large libraries, searches without database may take +30 secs or
	even minutes, while using the database will be pretty instant.

	-Read from files: To retrieve the fingerprint tags within
	foobar2000, the tags must be either cached or read from	files.
	Caching requires RAM usage which may be beyond the limits of x32
	binaries. Use x64 foobar2000 or the	'Read from files' option,
	which will read the tags without caching with ffprobe. This
	option is slower than caching to create the database though (but
	almost equal as fast for searching and comparing).
