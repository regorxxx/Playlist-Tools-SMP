Button for all Fingerprint Tools, fingerprint search and tagging.
There different options are explained below:

	-Compare: Compares the fingerprint of the currently selected
	tracks and reports the similarity between them (in pairs).

	-Search: Searches the entire Foobar2000 library for tracks
	with similar fingerprint to the currently selected tracks.

	-Tag: Tags the currently selected tracks with fingerprints.
	For Chromaprint, the raw fingerprint is saved, not the
	encoded version provided by default by fpcalc.exe or other
	software like MusisBrainz Picard. Also the entire file
	is fingerprinted, not just the first 120 secs.

	-ChromaPrint database: Creates a reverse indexed database
	for faster lookups. Specially useful for large libraries.
	Requires to be recreated on library changes (automatically
	checked). In large libraries, searches without database
	may take +30 secs or even minutes, while using the database
	will be pretty instant.

	-Read from files: To retrieve the fingerprint tags within
	foobar2000, the tags must be either cached or read from
	files. Caching requires RAM usage which may be beyond
	the limits of x32 binaries. Use x64 foobar2000 or the
	'Read from files' option, which will read the tags without
	caching with ffprobe. This option is slower than caching
	to create the database though (but almost equal as fast
	for searching and comparing).

	-FooID tagging: requires 'foo_biometric' to be installed
	on Foobar2000, 	along its 'Fooid.dll'. All required files
	can be found at '_resources', along installation notes.

FooID or ChromaPrint versions available.

CHROMAPRINT TOOLS MAY HAVE LIMITATIONS ON x32 FOOBAR2000 AND
SMP ENGINE. SEE:
