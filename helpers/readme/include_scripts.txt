An utility to easily include ('merge') multiple SMP scripts into the same panel, thus not wasting multiple panels. Useful for those scripts that don't require any UI, user interaction, etc. 

Note you must only include simple utility scripts without UI!. Like scripts which set the main menu SPM entries (File\Spider Monkey Panel) and do nothing more.

The use of this functionality is done at your own responsibility, it may obviously break things if you use it without thinking.
In any case, you can later remove the included script at any point or disable the functionality altogether (just disable the associated menu). 

If the file fails while loading, it will probably crash and will not be added for later startups... so just reload panel and done.
