Tool to compare tags between 2 sets of tracks (Source and Destination).
May be used to compare changes between backups and current library tracks
and\or apply tags from one source to another.

For ex. applying current library tags to your backup, thus updating it,
without having to copy all the files again. Useful on local networks.

Usage:
- Send all tracks from Source to a new playlist:
	+ Select Source tracks, and save their tags to JSON file.

- Send all tracks from Destination  to a playlist:
	+ Select Destination tracks and compare them against previously
	created	JSON tags file (from Source).

- Via input popups, you may replace root paths for comparing:
	+ Source may be at: H:\Music\...	     ->  Root: 'H:\'
	+ Destination may be at: D:\Backup\Music\... ->  Root: 'D:\Backup\'
	+ It's supposed that both directory trees -minus the root- should
	be identical. Matches are found by path (and filename).

- Tool will report non-matched files. i.e. files at Destination not present
 on Source.
	- Comparison is asymmetrical. Files from Source not present on
	Destination will not be reported but silently skipped.
	- If you want to report missing files in both directions, then
	perform the comparison in 2 steps (A to B and B to A).

- Tool will report matched files with tag differences found.
	- Tags from Source tracks may be applied to Destination tracks in
	such case, if desired.
	- Only files with differences will be edited, thus last modified
	timestamps will only change in such cases.
