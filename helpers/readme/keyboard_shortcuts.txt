Keyboard Shortcuts is an UI-only feature bypassing SMP limits 
which makes use of SMP dynamic menus and a json helper file
to display the keys associated to entries. 

First enable dynamic menus at Playlist Tools:
Script integration\SMP Dynamic menu\Enabled SMP dynamic menus.
This will allow foobar to run Playlist tools menu as if it were
the native one. i.e. to allow binding a keyboard shortcut to an entry.

Keyboard shortcuts should be set at foobar main menu:
File\Preferences\Keyboard shortcuts
You may check the shortcut is show tabbed at the right at the main menu:
File\Spider Monkey Panel\Script Commands\[Panel Name]\...

Once the keyboard shortcut is set and working, edit the shortcuts file 
to reflect the keys associated to the menu entry. Once an entry 
is properly set, the shortcut will also be shown at the button's menu,
similar to the Foobar main menu above.

AFTER EDITING SHORCUTS FILE, CHANGES WILL BE REFLECTED ON PANEL RELOAD.
