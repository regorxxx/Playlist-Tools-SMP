Replaces selection tools included on foo_menu_addons (known to crash):
https://hydrogenaud.io/index.php?topic=47332.0

Tools included:
	- Invert selection: inverts selection on current playlist.
	- Move selection to: moves (cut) current selection to another place on
	current playlist or now playing playlist.
	- Expand: extends current selection according to TF expression or tag matching
	(for ex. select all tracks by same artists than the currently selected tracks).
	- Jump: moves cursor to next/previous track which doesn't match a TF expression
	or tag from selected tracks.
	
* Move Selection:
	- By delta value: shifts the current position of the selection by X value,
	which may be positive (down on the playlist) or negative (up). If X would 
	put the selection below 0 position or over the current playlist length, 
	then the selection is shifted up to that point... i.e. no cycling. Note 
	disjoint selections will remain disjoint while being displaced, unless
	the first/last track is already at the top/bottom of the playlist, when 
	the other tracks will continue to be displaced until they are joined and 
	can not be moved anymore.
	- To the middle: cuts current selection, finds the middle and then inserts
	it at that place. Note disjoint selections become joint after insertion.
	- After playing now track: cuts current selection, finds the currently playing
	track (which may be at a different playlist) and then inserts the selection
	at that place. Note disjoint selections become joint after insertion.
	
* Expand Selection:
	- Tags: may be a single tag (%artist%) or a list of tags (%artist%;%title%).
	Any other track from the current playlist which matches at least one of those
	tags (compared against the entire set of tags values from the current selection)
	will be included in the selection. The bigger the current selection, the weaker
	the matching conditions will be, since only a match is required. i.e. if you 
	select 5 different artists, expand will match any track from any of those 5 artists
	(not only tracks which have those 5 artists at the same time).
	- TF Expression: full fledged TF expressions may be used to find matches. This may be
	considered as the alternative to query filtering (where output is selection instead of
	a new playlist). For ex. to select tracks with the same folder one level over the 
	current one $directory(%path%,2) may be used. Like tags, multiple TF expressions
	may be used too separated by ';'.
	
* Jump:
	- Uses the same logic than Expand Selection but stops as soon at it finds one track
	not matching the condition. That will be the newly selected track (and focus is moved
	to that position).
