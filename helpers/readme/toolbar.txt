Toolbar panel allows to fully configure sub-modules loaded as buttons.
R. Click to configure the toolbar:
	- Add new buttons
	- Remove
	- Change order
	- Restore defaults
	- Change colors
	- Change text size
	- Change orientation and buttons wrap
	
Hold R. Click to reorder buttons.
	
The button list is automatically built from this path: '.\buttons\*.js'

Some buttons can be 'duplicated'. i.e. having multiple instances with
different settings. Whenever that's not possible, menu entry will be
greyed if there is already copy of the same button on the toolbar.

Finally, some buttons may require another one to be loaded first... it's
also indicated in the related entry if the requirement is not met.

Once added, check their tooltips to find relevant info about their usage, 
settings, mouse + key modifiers, etc. Buttons which are meant to be
configured using the properties panel have their prefix added to the
tooltip text ('sbd0', 'rd0', ...) to make it easier to find their
associated properties.

Note every button has its own configuration, they are NOT shared. i.e.
if you add 3 buttons of the same tool, everyone must be configured
separately (for ex. for tag remapping).
