All the tools use this universal tag structure:

Rationale: It's not feasible to support arbitrary tag names when there are
a dozen of tools using their own. Also tag names should use standard names
and not proprietary names. Proprietary tags like "GENRE LAST.FM" are only
meant as intermediary tags which should be renamed, remapped or merged.

If you use other tag names then you have these options:
1. Rename your tags.
2. Clone your tags and use names at top.
3. Configure scripts to remap standard tags to your own tags.
4. Configure your tagging tools to output proper tag names.

WARNING: All tags will be split by comma into multiple values. This is
specially important for 'genre' or 'style' tags, since values like:
'Folk, World, & Country' will be split into 'Folk', 'World', '& Country'.
Tag properly your files to avoid this situation.

NOTE: See 'Global tag Remap' readme for permanent remapping in all tools.

Example:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have used the BIO panel to tag my files, and they are all tagged with
things like: "ALBUM GENRE ALLMUSIC", "ALBUM GENRE LAST.FM",
"ALBUM THEME ALLMUSIC", ...

I also have my own genre tag named as "MY GENRE".

Finally I have retrieved keys for my tracks using Traktor and the tag is
written as "INITIAL KEY".

- GENRE:
(1) Is not possible for genres, since I intend to use all of them (3 tags).

(2) Would be possible, Masstagger for ex. allows to merge different tags
into one new field. I could simply retag all my tracks this way with a new
tag name "GENRE" which contains the values of the other 3.

(3) Probably the best option. For ex. Playlist Tools or Music Map
already allow to remap any group of tags to GENRE, merging their values
and removing duplicates, without touching the files. I will have to look
for "Tag remapping" at the associated buttons in their config.

(4) Picard allows to use scripting to set tag names before writing tags to
files. This is obviously meant for these use-cases where you have different
sources for a tag meant to be the same (genre on All Music, Last Fm, ...)
and they should be merged or properly named. Same comment applies for other
tools. BIO may be configured too, for ex. "ALBUM THEME ALLMUSIC"
could be saved as just "THEME" if that's the only tag source used.

- KEY:
(1) "INITIALL KEY" may be renamed to "KEY" for all my files.

(2) Idem. Trivial to clone single tag as "Key".

(3) Idem. Remapping would allow to use the tag 'as is' without touching
the original files or rewriting all tags.

(4) It would be easier if from now on if I configure Traktor to write tag
as "KEY".
