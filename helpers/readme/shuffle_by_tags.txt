Shuffles tracks according to tags (for ex. artist) in a semi-random
pattern, ensuring no 2 consecutive tracks have the same tag. 

Differs from 'Scatter by tags' (intercalate) in the way tracks are
ordered (without strict alternation), i.e. it doesn't follow a pattern
(ABCABAA) when it's possible to ensure no A tracks are together (ABACABA).
