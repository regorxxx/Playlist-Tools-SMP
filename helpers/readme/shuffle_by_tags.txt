Shuffles tracks according to tags (for ex. artist) in a semi-random
pattern, ensuring no 2 consecutive tracks have the same tag and
also that they are distributed in an homogeneous way.

Differs from intercalation in the way tracks are ordered (without 
strict alternation), i.e. it doesn't follow a pattern (ABCABCAA) 
when it's possible to ensure no A tracks are together (CABACABA).

Contrary to [Spotify's preferences to recently played/loved tracks]
(https://thetab.com/uk/2021/11/17/spotify-shuffle-explained-228639),
this algorithm is truly "random", by default, in the sense that 
there is no preference for any track, it just ensures artists are
distributed evenly with some randomness (so they don't appear in
clusters).

The sorting bias may be configured to prioritize tracks by play
count, rating, popularity or a custom TitleFormat expression.

There is an additional option to also try to avoid consecutive
tracks with  these conditions:
	- Instrumental tracks. 
	- Live tracks.
	- Female/male vocals tracks.

These rules apply in addition to the main smart shuffle,
swapping tracks position whenever possible without altering
the main logic.
