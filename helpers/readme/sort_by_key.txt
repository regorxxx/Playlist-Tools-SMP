Sorts tracks by key using Camelot Wheel notation, translating first keys to it (A#m -> 3A).
Note there is no way to sort tracks by Key using standard title formating since keys don't
follow an ordered set with numbers and letters which may be naturally sorted.

Uses notation described at 'camelotWheel' on camelot_wheel_xxx.js to sort selection by key.
