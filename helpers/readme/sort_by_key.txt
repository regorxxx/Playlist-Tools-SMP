Sorts tracks by key using Camelot Wheel notation, translating first keys
to it (A#m -> 3A). Note there is no way to sort tracks by Key using
standard title formatting since keys don't follow an ordered set with
numbers and letters which may be naturally sorted.

Uses notation described at 'camelotWheel' on camelot_wheel_xxx.js to sort
selection by key.

Supports Camelot Keys, Open Keys and Standard notation.
