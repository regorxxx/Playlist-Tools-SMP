Additional settings applicable to all scripts may be found at:
AppData\Roaming\foobar2000\js_data\presets\global\*.json

(or profile folder in portable installations)

Such 'global' folder contains multiple *.json files which
expose different global settings shared by all scripts.

For ex. the default fonts used, the tooltip font, update
checking, etc.

To edit them, just open the file in any text editor and
read the descriptions and variables. They should be self
explanatory.

Note the panels must be reloaded (or foobar2000 restarted)
to apply the new settings. 

Also note in some cases these settings are the default 
values used the first time a panel is installed... i.e.
changing them afterwards will not change such settings
on an already panel. This usually happens when that setting
can also be customized within the panel. 

For ex. the tooltip font is applied after reload/restart,
since it is not configurable via panels, but the default
tags set at 'globTags.json' are applied in most cases once
at installation. Since scripts like Playlist-Tools-SMP or
Search-By-Distance-SMP allow to configure tags and queries,
those are only the values used by default. But once installed,
they can only be changed via menus (or editing the properties
panel).
