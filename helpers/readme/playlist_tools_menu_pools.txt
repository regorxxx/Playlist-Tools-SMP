Playlist creation similar to Random Pools component.
Multiple playlists \ library sources (pools) can be set to fill a 
destination playlist. Configurable selection length per source,
query filtering, picking method (random, from start, from end) and
final sorting of destination playlist. 

Usage:
  - Set sources:
    - Playlists matching the source names must exist to be used (*)
    - As source name, _LIBRARY_#, where # is a number, may be used.
    - As source name, SEARCHBY$_#, where $ is GRAPH\WEIGHT\DYNGENRE, 
    may be used. (**)
  - Set other parameters:
    - The query will be applied to the current source to get eligible 
    tracks.
      - Empty query will try to apply global forced query if 
      enabled, otherwise is 'ALL'.
      - 'ALL' will never apply forced query, even if enabled.
      - Dynamic queries may be used. i.e. 'GENRE IS #GENRE#'. (***)
    - Duplicates are removed after query (by artist|title|date).
    - Any track already selected for final playlist in previous steps 
    is removed.
    - Finally tracks are chosen using the picking method set.
    - Source(s) with less tracks than pool(s) size will use all tracks.
  - Final playlist is created with tracks from all pools. 

(*) Playlist may be loaded within foobar or playlist files tracked by 
Playlist Manager panels. Playlist A would match first a playlist within
foobar with same name, then a playlist file with matching 
'#PLAYLIST:Playlist A' tag and finally any playlist file named 
'Playlist A.m3u8'. Autoplaylists are excluded (use queries instead)
and fpl files too.

(**) Output from 'Search by (method)' as source, setting source name as 
'_SEARCHBYGRAPH_#', etc. (where # is any number). Allows spotify-like
 source creation instead of using queries for the pool.
 
Can be used multiple times (beware of computing time) and mixed with the 
other sources types. This new source may only be used by creating a preset
pool with a text editor, since it requires to set so many arguments that
is not reasonable to do it via popups.

'recipe' and 'theme' keys must be set when using this type of source (a 
recipe may force a theme too). Both may point to a filename (i.e. another
 preset like themes) or contain the arguments object.
Examples can be found in the presets folder for all use-cases. 
Also see 'Search similar by... (recipes\themes)'.

(***) For a selected rock track, 'GENRE IS #GENRE#' would translate into 
'GENRE IS Rock'. Thus using the currently selected track to define the
 pool behavior. Also see 'Dynamic Queries' readme.
