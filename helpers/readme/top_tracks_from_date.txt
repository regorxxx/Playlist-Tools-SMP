Search n most played tracks from a given period on library. Sorting 
is done by play count by default (requires foo_playcount and
foo_enhanced_playcount plugins).

In other words, 'Most played from 2022' will display the most played
tracks during 2022 (not with %DATE% equal to 2022!). This is similar
to Spotify playlists showing you the most played tracks in last year
but here extended to any date or desired period.

Duplicates by title - artist - date are removed, so it doesn't 
output the same tracks multiple times like an auto-playlist does
(if you have multiple versions of the same tracks or albums).
