Filters handle list or playlist using queries.
Similar to what foobar search or some search/filter plugins do.

Empty query will try to apply global forced query if enabled, otherwise gets replaced with 'ALL'.
'ALL' will never apply forced query, even if enabled.

Dynamic variables are allowed too, enclosed on '#':
#ARTIST#, #$year(%date%)#, ...
These placeholders will be replaced with focused item\'s result on execution.
See Dynamic Query readme for more info.
