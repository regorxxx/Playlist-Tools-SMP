Evaluates and display any custom Title Format expression against now
playing, or selected track(s). It also works with global variables
related to volume, playing state or playlists.

Notes:
	- Also works with dynamic queries, which add extra variables like
	#NOW# (current date), #MONTH#, #PLSNAME# (playlist name), etc.

	- All special variables can be found on 'Dynamic queries' readme.

	- Has a fallback expression which is evaluated when there is no
	track available (no selection, no playing and empty playlist).

	- Also allows direct input over the button (but only basic actions,
	i.e. writing char, delete and enter). Use menus in any other case.

	- Font size, alignment, style, etc. can be set via menus.

	- Display area size can be set by a fixed amount or percentage of
	total panel width.

	- To alleviate processing on large selections, there is a max.
	refresh rate setting, so it's only updated once on this interval.
