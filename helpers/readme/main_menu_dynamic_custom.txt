An utility to easily set main Spider Monkey Panel menu entries
found at 'File\Spider Monkey Panel\Script Commands\[Panel Name]...'.

Contrary to the automatic functionality which exposes most menus,
see 'SMP Dynamic menu' readme, the custom menus allow to add an
indefinite amount of menu entries with customized names and
functionality:
	- Custom menu entries.
	- Custom functions on a script file.
	- Some predefined tools.

The menus can be easily set at any time without coding at all to 
arbitrary functions (associated to an script which is 'included'
automatically), menu entries or predefined examples. They can also
be removed or restored to defaults values at any time.

Note that if you don't want to use this tool and use your own panel
with an script to set the menus, you can simply disable the
associated menu (like any other tool) to skip loading it.

This utility is also a way to integrate Playlist Tools
with online controllers. Since online controllers like
foo_httpcontrol (https://bitbucket.org/oblikoamorale/foo_httpcontrol/wiki/Home)
can not interact in any way with custom buttons, UI elements 
or SMP scripts, the only way to 'use' some of these scripts is associating
a tool to a main menu entry. 

Some examples of remote commands (*) (**):
	
	- Wanna create automatic playlists via pools using your phone
	or an internet browser? Set a menu with name 'xxx' to
	'Pools\Top tracks mix'.
	Then call it via http control server:
	http://localhost:8888/default?cmd=CmdLine&param1=/command:"xxx"
	
	Playlist will be created and set as active playlist. A refresh
	may be needed in the online controller to change focus to the
	currently active playlist (otherwise switch to it manually).
	
	- What about removing duplicates from current playlist? Set a
	menu with name 'xxx' to to 'Duplicates and tag filtering\Remove
	duplicates by title, artist, date'.
	Fill any playlist in your online controller and then call it via
	http control server:
	http://localhost:8888/default?cmd=CmdLine&param1=/command:"xxx"
	
	And it will be applied to current playlist. Same comment apply
	about refreshing.
	
	- What about searching similar tracks to current one? Set a menu
	with name 'xxx' to 'Search same by tags...\By Styles (=2)
	and Moods (=6)'.
	Focus on any song in your online controller and then call it via
	http control server:
	http://localhost:8888/default?cmd=CmdLine&param1=/command:"xxx"
	
	And it will use that track as input for the playlist creation. 
	Same comment apply about refreshing.

foo_httpcontrol even allows to create your own templates (for the web UI),
so instead of using an http url, you can easily create your own buttons
associated to SMP entries for direct access. Since SMP even allows to set
output devices with scripts, this piece finally allows to treat foobar as
a complete music server capable of replacing online servers like Spotify
with intelligent playlist creation, auto-dj, etc. You can control anything
via foo_httpcontrol+SMP+Playlist Tools.

Such template already exists and it's named ajquery-xxx:

A phone App like 'HTTP Request Shortcuts' can also automatize all this
process if using an App, which obviously can not be user-set to add
custom buttons. Otherwise, http urls must be sent via browser (*).

(*) Another approach would be sending commands creating playlists with
specific command names. Specially useful for phone Apps. See 
'Playlist Names Commands' readme.

(**) Menu names may be easily retrieved by simulating menu execution with
 Ctrl + L. Click, which copies entry names to clipboard.
