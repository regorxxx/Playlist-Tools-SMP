Selects tracks which fit into desired time, having into account crossfade
between tracks: https://hydrogenaud.io/index.php?topic=127167

Entries marked with '(crossfade)' show an input box where crossfade time
can be specified in seconds (float numbers allowed).

Any other entry just considers the track length in seconds. The predefined
entry for random X minutes is based on the global playlist size set.
