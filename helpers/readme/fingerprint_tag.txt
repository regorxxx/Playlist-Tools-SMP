Shortcut button for Fingerprint Tools' entry.

Tag the currently selected tracks with fingerprints.
FooID or Chromaprint versions available.

For Chromaprint, the raw fingerprint is saved, not the
encoded version provided by default by fpcalc.exe or other
software like MusicBrainz Picard. Also the entire file
is fingerprinted, not just the first 120 secs.

FooID tagging: requires 'foo_biometric' to be installed
on Foobar2000, 	along its 'Fooid.dll'. All files required
can be found at '_resources', along installation notes.

MOST CHROMAPRINT TOOLS ARE GREYED OUT DUE TO LIMITATIONS ON CURRENT
FOOBAR2000 AND SMP ENGINE.
