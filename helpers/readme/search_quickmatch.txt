Tool similar to foo_quicksearch, which allows searching for tracks
matching specific tag values (shown in a list). Results may be sent 
to a playlist, Autoplaylist or search window using keyboard modifiers
(shown on the tool).

Original foo_quicksearch:
https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_quicksearch

Buttons usage:
	- Works similar to ListenBrainz and Last.fm tools buttons.
	- By default sends results to a [configurable] playlist.
	- Shift sends results to search window.
	- Ctrl creates an Autoplaylist with the result.
	- Shit + Ctrl uses the current playlist as source for the lookup.
	- To add customized entries, configure the button pressing shift.
	- Matches a single value per tag (selectable), instead of
		all or nothing approach found at quicksearch tools.
